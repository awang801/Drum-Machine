TR 808 Drum Machine in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript

Authors: John McCain, Audrey Evans, Hari Ramanan, and Alan Wang

For Prof. Gibbons' EECS 448 class

This drum machine is modeled after the Roland TR808, the classic drum machine that has profoundly effected popular music since it's introduction in the early 1980s.

Sounds are samples of a real TR808 with knobs at several positions (with resolution of 5 samples per knob).  The samples were made by [Michael Fischer & Hyperreal](http://smd-records.com/tr808/?page_id=14).

The MyBufferLoader.js file is based off of [BufferLoader.js](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/js/buffer-loader.js) from HTML5Rocks.com.

Resources used include JQuery and jsdoc.

You can access the prototype of the drum machine [here](http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jmccain/Project_3/TR808.html).
